# Picabia seams in upstream FigCraft files

Every edit Picabia makes to a file that comes from upstream FigCraft is a *seam*: as few lines as
possible, calling into Picabia code, marked `// PICABIA: <reason>` (`rg "PICABIA:"` lists them).
When an upstream merge conflicts, resolve it seam by seam with this table, then run `cargo xtask ci`.
